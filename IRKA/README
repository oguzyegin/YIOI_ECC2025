# IRKA Example A very rudimentary and simple implementation of the
iteratively corrected rational Krylov algorithm for $H_2$ model
reduction proposed by Gugercin, Antoulas and Beattie
[GugercinAntoulasBeattie08]. Part of this work is taken from the
thesis of Heiko K.F. Panzer [Panzer14].

This implementation was made for the Paper BEST PRACTICES FOR
NUMERICAL REPLICABILITY, REPRODUCIBILITY AND REUSABILITY EXEMPLIFIED
BY MODEL REDUCTION SOFTWARE

This code is published under the BSD3-Clause License.

This implementation either runs with Matlab or with Octave

## Installation

1. No installation is required. Simply copy the files to a directory
on your MATLAB path or change to the directory and run the examples in
RUNME.m
